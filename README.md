# Interactive Excel Dashboard for google play store

-The organization wants to add a new application to the application market and wants to know the preferences of application market users and what types of applications they prefer. 
To help them, I built an interactive Dashboard using the Excel tool

-All phases of ETL processes have been implemented in this project


# the Dashboard
The Slicer feature was used to easily select the data to be extracted. three types of charts were used: columns, lines and bars.
